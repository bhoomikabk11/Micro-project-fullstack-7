This directory is for storing pet background images that will appear on all pages.

## Recommended Images

To add pet photos in the background, place the following image files in this directory:

- `dog1.png` - Dog image for top-left corner (200x200px recommended)
- `dog2.png` - Dog image for top-right corner (180x180px recommended)

- `dog4.png` - Dog image for bottom-right corner (190x190px recommended)
- `dog-center.png` - Large dog image for center background (300x300px recommended)

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (recommended) or JPG
- **Size**: 150-250px width/height for corner images, 250-350px for center
- **Style**: Cute, friendly pet images (dogs, cats, etc.)
- **Transparency**: PNG with transparent background works best
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web to reduce load time

## Where to Find Images

You can use:
- Free stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)
- Pet adoption stock photos

- Your own pet photos

## Note

If images are not available, the CSS will still work with decorative gradients and the site will function normally. The background images are optional enhancements.
